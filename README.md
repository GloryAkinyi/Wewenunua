# Jetpack Compose MVVM App with Firebase & Cloudinary

This project demonstrates how to build a modern Android application using **Jetpack Compose** and **MVVM architecture**, integrating **Firebase Authentication** for user registration/login and **Firebase Realtime Database** for product CRUD operations.  
Product images are uploaded to **Cloudinary**, and only the image URL is stored in Firebase alongside the product details.
